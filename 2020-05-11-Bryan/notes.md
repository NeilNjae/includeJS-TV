## Lessons learned 🤔

* Carousels are and remain [evil](http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/)

* floats, on the other hand, are not evil!

* Don't write more HTML just to solve the layout (example: adding more classes to figure out flexbox)

* `fr` stands for fraction unit

* grid columns and row start at 1 (not 0)

* CSS [pseudo classes VS pseudo selectors](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/05/an-ultimate-guide-to-css-pseudo-classes-and-pseudo-elements/)

* you can give `grid-template-areas` any name you want

* CSS Grid is supported in 95% of browsers.

* [CSS Feature queries](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/08/using-feature-queries-in-css/) are cool.

* "Falling forward": code the baseline and add an extra for browsers that support it.

* Flex gap property is coming! 🎉

* In `display: grid` you get rid off collapsed margins!
