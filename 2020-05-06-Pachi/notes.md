## Lessons learned 🤔

* some HTML tags are self-closing, some are not. If you're not sure, you can always add a closing tag (nothing will break)

* in VSCode, to get the HTML boilerplate, you can type "!" then hit tab ⌨️

* VSCode is not the same as Visual Studio (the first one is a text editor, the second one is an IDE)

* `<div>` stands for Division!

* If you want to open a link in a new tab, your `<a>` tag should have `target="_blank"`

* It's a good idea to put your colors and other things that you'll re-use throughout the app in a [CSS variable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)


## Funny quotes 💬

* (Pachi): "HTML is the backbone of a website and CSS is the makeup."
* (Pachi): "You have to close your tags, people!"
