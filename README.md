# Welcome 👋

This repository is the home for the notes made during the "Teach Me Something" [Twitch streams](https://www.twitch.tv/edieblu).

## Would you like to contribute? 🗒️

If you have watched the stream and taken notes, please add them to this repository!

### But how? ✋

To contribute to this repository:
1. fork the repository,
2. add your changes and
3. create a Pull Request.

If you don't know how to do that, don't worry, one of our future streams will talk about `git` and GitHub!

## What makes for good notes? 🤔

Please add what you've learned including:
- resources
- general tips & tricks
- keyboard shortcuts
- best practice
- sketches and doodles
- photos
- ideas


## The format 📏

The notes for each stream will live inside a directory. Each directory will have a main `notes.md` file, but other files (sketches, photos) can be added to the directory as well.
