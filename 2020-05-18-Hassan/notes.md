## Resources üìï

* [Trello](https://trello.com/) for managing tasks and people

* [Slack](https://slack.com/) for managing team communication

* [Discord](https://discord.com/) another chatting tool (especially popular in the game community)

* [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) for streaming stuff

## Lessons learned ü§î
* [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) and the gaming community is huge!

* The Steam audience is people between the ages of 15-25.

* It's hard to establish yourself as a new game developer.

* Discipline and hard work bring results (and you're never too young to start a business).

* Diversify your revenue streams and adapt.

* Community guidelines - code of conduct - are crucial for managing an online community. Have moderators to enact it.

* If you can't imagine running your business in one-years time, sell it. If you're not enjoying running your business, sell it! Sometimes you need to sell when things are best (things might go downhill at any moment!).

## How to start a business
* Web agency: checkout other people that are already successful at it, don't forget to network, specialize, learn in public and stay away from hourly pricing (go for flat rate pricing instead!)

* Becoming a technical founder (CTO): there are many platforms where people (with ideas and potentially money) are looking to connect with someone with the right technical skill.

* Start your own business: don't aim for perfect, get the V1 out the door as soon as possible and validate that your idea/product is useful (don't worry about polishing and perfection until V2)
