## Resources 📕

* [Object-oriented Programming in JavaScript: Made Super Simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFmuCDHHpwk) (by Mosh)

* [WatchandCode](https://watchandcode.com/) - is where I learned about Objects first

## Lessons learned 🤔

* `Object.create()`: creates a new object, using an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object.

* Objects are used for grouping related data together

* Objects have properties and methods.

* When an object is created in JavaScript, JavaScript engine adds a `__proto__` property to the newly created object (called **dunder proto**!).

### Comparison in Objects
* `{} === {}` (is `false`)
* When you create an object that object gets saved in a unique location in the memory.
* Meaning, the objects might look identical, but that doesn't mean that they are the same object 🤔.

Why? Because you are comparing two different objects!

## Quotes
* About web development: "If you decide to close your eyes for a few seconds, you are outdated."

* "Everything is an object."

* Functions are objects too! 🤯
